            <hr>
            <p>
              College isn’t only about what is taught in your classrooms. On campus, learning takes place absolutely
              everywhere&mdash;and this includes your involvement in clubs and organizations. College students don’t join
              clubs, activities, and teams to improve their transcripts; they join because of a sincere interest or
              passion in a particular area. Every campus boasts a large number of student-run clubs and organizations,
              and unlike in high school, you’ll have quite a bit of free time to get involved and choose how committed
              you want to be in each club or organization you join.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if your first semester of college ends up with a delayed start time or moves online, you can still
              get a jump on learning about clubs and organizations at your new school this summer and begin to get
              involved as an incoming student. You’ll be surprised how connecting to an existing group of students who
              share some of your passions will leave you excited about your life outside of the classroom once you do
              arrive on campus. During this pandemic, many almost-college students feel that the fall semester ahead is
              so tentative. Yet beginning to get connected, even from your home, can make you feel much more a part of
              your new campus.
            </p>
            <!-- <p class="block-quote">
              Mindfulness brings awareness to the volume of the thoughts swirling in your head, or in the
              world around you, so you can really connect to the moment in front of you.
            </p> -->
            <h4 class="blog-heading">How do I choose?</h4>
            <p>
              Many new students participate in two or even three clubs, organizations, or groups during their first
              semester of college. This can remain the same, even if your first semester of college takes place online.
              There are two different ways to choose clubs and organizations in college:
              <ol>
                <li class="blog-li">
                  You can drop some or all of your high school identities (as a soccer player, singer, debater) and try
                  a brand new activity on for size. College is a time to try some completely new activities you’ve never
                  had a chance to join before, or even return to some of the activities you liked as a child.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alternatively, you can really hone one of your current passions and develop skills to excel in it at
                  the college level. Now that your resume isn’t focused on gathering various activities, as it likely
                  was in high school, you can focus on one or more areas that you care about.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                There are many different types of college clubs and organizations available to students, although the
                language used to describe them may differ by campus. Here is a list of the most common categories with
                examples of each:
                <ul class="blog-list">
                  <li><strong>Academic Organizations</strong>: undergraduate history club or a film students’
                    association</li>
                  <li><strong>Cultural Diversity Groups</strong>: Black Student Alliance or a Korean student
                    association</li>
                  <li><strong>Faith/Spirituality Organizations</strong>: Hillel or a gospel choir</li>
                  <li><strong>Professional Clubs</strong>: International Sociology Honors Society or business students
                    association</li>
                  <li><strong>Sports/Fitness Groups</strong>: intramural volleyball team or a hiking club</li>
                  <li><strong>Political Groups</strong>: College Student Republicans or Students for Justice in
                    Palestine</li>
                  <li><strong>Publication Teams</strong>: campus newspaper or a photography journal</li>
                  <li><strong>Honors/Achievement Clubs</strong>: a business club or Future Teachers of America</li>
                  <li><strong>Public Service/Civic Organizations</strong>: Get Out the Vote or local elementary school
                    tutoring</li>
                  <li><strong>Fraternal Organizations</strong>: social, professional, or community service
                    sorority/fraternity</li>
                  <li><strong>Performance Groups</strong>: Shakespeare theater group or an improv comedy troupe</li>
                  <li><strong>Social Clubs</strong>: gamers group or a Harry Potter club</li>
                  <li><strong>College Representation</strong>: campus tour guide or student representative to the
                    Board of Trustees</li>
                </ul>

                  <strong>Check out your school's campus life website</strong>. Set aside some time to check out your
                  school’s campus life or student activities website, which will
                  have a list of the student clubs and organizations sponsored by the school and the contact
                  information of their student leaders. This task might seem overwhelming at first, as there might be
                  hundreds of groups listed. Don’t worry—just go slowly and make a list of the organizations that (at
                  least by name and category) interest you at this time.
                </li>
                <li class="blog-li">
                  <strong>Do a bit of research</strong>. Check out each club or organization’s presence online. They
                  will most likely
                  have a website, a Facebook page, and/or an Instagram account which will give you an idea of the
                  club’s mission, its past programming, and the students who are involved. For example, if you are
                  interested in pursuing a passion for sports, make sure to look at the intramural teams, club sports,
                  and also the opportunities that exist through your school’s fitness center or gym. If you want to
                  learn more about opportunities for singers, check out the school-sponsored chorus(es) and the
                  student-run acapella groups and bands.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reach out</strong>. Send a message by email or through the club’s social media account to the
                  students who lead the
                  clubs that most interest you and introduce yourself as an incoming student. Request to be added to
                  their mailing list and ask any questions you might have about the number of students involved in the
                  group, if there is a fee to participate, or the time commitment for new members. Ask how you can get
                  connected to meet some of the current members, prepare for auditions, or learn about what current
                  students in the group are doing to stay involved. Most importantly, don’t forget that the majority
                  of the students currently involved in your school’s clubs and organizations are also stuck at home
                  and have most likely found ways to stay connected with their groups. As an interested incoming
                  member, you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how welcomed these students will make you feel.

              <p style="margin: 20px 20px 0px 20px;">
                Studies show that being involved in clubs and organizations expands first-year students’ organizational
                and managerial skills, prepares them for college-level academic group projects, and helps to diversify
                their friend groups.
              </p>
              <p class="block-quote3" style="padding: 0px 0px 0px 36px;">
                Students also report that their college clubs and organizations provide them with
                practical situations to use the skills they learn in classes.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">
                One of the hidden benefits of joining a
                club or organization as a first-year student is the regular interaction you’ll have with upper-class
                students
                who can introduce you to others in the group and offer advice about classes and professors. This is
                true, regardless if your first involvement in the club is virtually or in person.
